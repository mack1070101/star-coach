# 🌟 STAR Coach

A CLI tool that helps job candidates practice giving STAR answers (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for interviews with timed sections and beautiful progress bars.

## ✨ Features

- **Timed Practice Sessions**: Each STAR section has configurable timing
- **Enhanced CLI Interface**: Rich interactive interface with prompt_toolkit
- **Flexible Input**: Works with `.org` or `.txt` files
- **Default Fallbacks**: Uses sensible defaults when no file is provided
- **Real-time Progress**: Live progress bars that update every second
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works with or without prompt_toolkit
- **Interactive Controls**: Keyboard shortcuts for pause/resume/quit

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

**Option 1: Homebrew (macOS) - Enhanced Version**
```bash
brew tap mack1070101/star-coach
brew install star-coach
```

**Option 2: Direct Download - Enhanced Version**
```bash
# Download the standalone script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mack1070101/star-coach/main/star_coach_standalone.py

# Install prompt_toolkit for enhanced interface
pip install prompt_toolkit

# Run it
python star_coach_standalone.py
```

**Option 3: Clone Repository - Enhanced Version**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mack1070101/star-coach.git
cd star-coach
pip install prompt_toolkit

```bash
# Download and run without prompt_toolkit
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mack1070101/star-coach/main/star_coach_standalone.py
python star_coach_standalone.py --basic
```

### Basic Usage

**Practice with default empty sections:**
```bash
star-coach
```

**Practice with a custom STAR file:**
```bash
star-coach --file example_star.org
```

**Force basic interface (no prompt_toolkit):**
```bash
star-coach --basic
```

## 🎨 Enhanced Interface Features

When `prompt_toolkit` is available, you get:

- **Full-screen interface** with rich formatting
- **Real-time progress bars** with smooth animations
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - **↑ Up Arrow**: Restart the current section
  - **↓ Down Arrow**: Quit/skip the current section
  - **← Left Arrow**: Skip back 5 seconds
  - **→ Right Arrow**: Skip forward 5 seconds
  - **Space**: Pause/resume the timer
  - **Q**: Quit the entire application
- **Color-coded sections** and content
- **Responsive layout** that adapts to terminal size
- **Mouse support** for interactive elements
- **Live status display** showing pause state and time remaining

## 📝 File Format

STAR Coach reads `.org` or `.txt` files with the following format:

```
* Pre Prompt
This text will appear at the top of every section. Use it for reminders, tips, or a motivational message!

* Situation: 3m
- I was working on a project with tight deadlines
- The team was struggling with coordination

* Task: 2m
- I needed to coordinate with multiple teams
- Create a timeline and ensure delivery

* Action: 4m
- I created a detailed timeline and held daily standups
- Implemented tracking tools and communication channels

* Result: 1m
- We delivered the project on time and under budget
- Team efficiency improved by 40%
```

### Pre Prompt Section
- If your file contains a section titled `* Pre Prompt`, its content will be displayed at the top of every STAR section (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
- This is useful for reminders, interview tips, or any message you want to see throughout your session.

### Timing Format
- **With timing**: `* SectionName: 3m` (3 minutes)
- **Without timing**: `* SectionName` (uses defaults)
- **Default times**: Situation (2m), Task (1m), Action (2m), Result (1m)
